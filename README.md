# Parts-Assembler-AR
An augmented Reality Application test template for assembling real-life object parts. 

This is a testing prototype, using a temporary place holder. 
Supposedly any kind of machinery that can be disassembled should work with this app as soon as I get to finish the final output.

For now I'll be only testing scripts/ functionality on this one.
